I've always been that gal – the marketer who never missed a beat. Deadlines? Crushed 'em. Campaigns? Launched 'em. Consistency? My middle name. I lived and breathed follow-through.

Until last year.

2023 hit, and I was dropping the ball. Big time. It was a weird feeling, like watching myself stumble in slow motion. I’d kick off a project, full of enthusiasm, ready to attack…and then, I’d fizzle out.

The ideas were there, the plans were drafted, but the oomph was MIA.

You know what this does to a marketer's soul? It chips away at your confidence faster than you can say "conversion rate."

## The thing about follow-through

Here's what no one tells you. Follow through? It's directly tied to how we see ourselves. You make a promise, you keep it – to your clients, your audience, yourself.

It's a self-respect thing. And the second you start breaking those promises, it creates this nasty little echo chamber of doubt.

"Why even bother starting if I can't finish?"
"What's wrong with me that I've lost my drive?"
"Maybe I'm not as good as I thought I was."

Ouch.

We all have off days, but when "off" becomes your norm, it's time to reset. But my reset didn’t come for over a year. Instead, it was a slow, painful progression into self-doubt. Into depression.

It was 2022. For me and my partners? We were going all in on our own idea. We were finally ready to take the gamble and turn away from client work.

So I booked a flight, hopped across continents, and sat down with my two best friends (aka biz partners) to turn a crazy dream into our first product.

If only that energy had continued.

## The slippery slope

You see, follow-through has always been my superpower. In my blogging days, I built a reputation for consistency.

Deadlines were sacred, and readers knew they could count on me. I understood the thrill of creating meaningful work.

Yet, somewhere along the way, I became the queen of half-starts. Unfinished tasks haunted me, mocking the person I could be if only I'd finished what I began.

In Q3 2022, we launched Hey Rebekah, a daily newsletter that helped professionals become better at what they do.

But even with a product I believed in, a pattern had emerged. I was trapped in an endless cycle of launching, but never marketing, never promoting, never truly engaging with the audience I wanted to serve.

And it wasn't just Hey Rebekah.

We created Roast My, offering brutal but constructive digital marketing critiques.

Then we built And Voila, a tool to protect creators' intellectual property in the AI era. Great ideas, brilliant execution…all quietly abandoned by me.

Product after product fell victim to my half-hearted marketing and silent launches. The world never saw our creations because that final step, that burst of promotion, always fell out of reach.

Not because I couldn’t, but because I didn’t believe I could. At least anymore.

## The weight of unfinished business

Turns out there's a name for this kind of self-doubt: the Zeigarnik Effect.

It's more than nagging guilt. Our brains are wired to crave completion, and unfinished projects? They create a kind of mental dissonance, draining our energy and confidence.

Every half-hearted attempt I made was another step toward convincing myself I couldn't rise again.

And that lack of follow-through? It’s a heavy burden. It gnawed away at me, chipping away at the foundation of who I was.

The marketer who'd always believed in fighting for her ideas was suddenly gone.

## The sting of regret

We've all been there. The half-baked projects, those grand ideas that never quite got off the ground. It's like watching a slow-motion trainwreck of your ambitions.

Think about it – you start strong, lay the first bricks of your plan, but then you never finish the damn thing. Every setback feels monumental, setting you further back.

That's the toll of unfinished business – a constant drain on your energy and belief in yourself.

I was living proof. Each abandoned project was another blow to my confidence, dismantling the go-getter mindset I'd built my career on.

My actions were screaming louder than my words. Turns out, as James Clear says, your daily choices are casting votes for who you want to become.

For too long, I'd been voting for a version of myself that was afraid to finish the fight.

## Facing the hard truth

The thing is, pretending everything's fine just makes things worse. It's in acknowledging the struggle that we find connection, a reminder that we're not alone in the moments of doubt.

That's why I'm putting this out there, despite the discomfort. Because chances are, I'm not the only one battling this beast.

And maybe, just maybe, there's power in knowing that even when it feels impossible, every tiny step forward is a rebellion against that nagging fear.

## How to find your fight

- **Name your fear.** Give it a shape, a voice. Is it perfectionism? Fear of rejection? Understanding the enemy is the first step to defeating it.
- **Celebrate the small wins.** Every time you say you’re gonna do it and you follow through, you're building momentum. Don't underestimate the power of those victories.
- **Get an accountability crew.** Find the people who see your potential and won't let you fall back on excuses. They'll be your lifeline on the days you feel like giving up. And also your mirror of truth to call your bullshit out.

## The road ahead

I'm not promising overnight transformation. Some days, the old self-doubt still creeps in. But there's a flicker of defiance now, a determination I haven't felt in a long time.

Don’t get me wrong. This isn’t only about fixing our business – it's about reclaiming the parts of myself that were buried under fear.

Fear that metastasized into a lack of follow-through.

So, here's the deal: I’m building in the open, owning the mistakes, rekindling the fire that first ignited this whole crazy ride.

And maybe, just maybe, my messy journey can be a reminder that it's never too late to rewrite your own story.
