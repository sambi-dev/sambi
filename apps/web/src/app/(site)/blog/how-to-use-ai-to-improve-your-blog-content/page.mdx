## Introduction

Look, let's crunch some numbers. **How much money** are we laundering? Yeah, apparently. All right, $16,000 [laundered at 75 cents](#) on the dollar, minus my fee, which is 17%, comes out to $9,960. Congratulations, you've just left your family a second hand Subaru.

### The hype and traps of using AI to hack SEO

Two words: nail, salon. It's perfect for money laundering, it's a high-volume, cash-preferred business with a discreet workforce. Nobody does mista-me-know-nothing better than Mrs. Mukjayaporn and her gals.

### Google's latest algorithm update: Bye-bye low-quality AI content

Did you not plan for this contingency? I mean the Starship Enterprise had a self-destruct button. I'm just saying. Yeah, you do seem to have a little 'shit creek' action going. Hey, nobody appreciates a passionate woman more than I do. But uh, in this business... and Walt can back me up on this... the uh, number one rule is, don't take things personally.

### Collabs between humans and AI can up your content game

Drum roll, please. Wait for it. Lazer tag. Lazer tag! 7,000 square feet of rollicking fun in the heart of northern Bernalillo County! It adds up perfectly. Walt's a scientist, scientists love lazers. Plus, they got bumper boats, so...

## The Risks of AI Addiction in Content Creation

Don't you get it? On the outside it's a nail salon right, on the inside it's the best money laundering a growing boy could ask for. Wait, wait! Come back here. Sit. Come on, come on... humor me here for a second. You know you need to launder your money, right? Do you understand the basics of it - placement, layering, integration. Well, you wanna stay out of jail don't ya? You wanna keep your money and your freedom. Cause I got three little letters for ya, I - R - S. If they can get Capone, they can get you.

### Yawn-worthy content lacking that special sauce

Hey look, here's you right - pink... Pinkman, get it? Here's your cash. You're out on the town, yeah you're partying hardy, you're knocking boots with the chicky babes and aww! Who's this? It's the tax man and he's looking at you. And what does he see? He sees a young fella, big fancy house, unlimited cash supply and no job. Now what is the conclusion the tax man makes? Aaaaannnt! Wrong! Millions times worse - you're a tax cheat. What do they do? They take every penny and you go in the can for felony tax evasion. Ouch! What was your mistake? You didn't launder your money! Now, you give me your money, okay that's called placement.

### Oops, wrong info alert! AI slip-ups and fake news

Hand me that little thing, bin. This is the nail salon, right. I take your dirty money and I slip it into the salon's nice clean cash flow - that's called layering. Final step - integration. The revenues from the salon go to the owner - that's you! Your filthy drug money has been transformed into nice clean taxable income brought to you by a savvy investment in a thriving business. Yeah and if you wanna stay a criminal and not become say a convict, then maybe you should grow up and listen to your lawyer.

## The Lowdown on AI and Intellectual Property

Yeah! Attorney-client privilege. I mean, that's a big one. That's something I provide for you. If I give up Pinkman, well, then you're gonna be asking, 'Ol' Saul gives 'em up pretty easy. What's to keep him from giving me up?' Y'see, so, then where's the trust?

### Plot twist: AI-generated content has zero copyright protection

You want your criminal associate taken into police custody? We declare just enough so as to not arouse suspicion, so Walt's one time winnings becomes seed money for an investment. If you're committed enough, you can make any story work. I once told a woman I was Kevin Costner, and it worked because I believed it.

It is not a disaster. It's not a disaster, alright? She's not going to the cops, she's not telling a living soul. You wanna know why? One word: blowback. If she blabs, it'll be a disaster - for her. That DEA brother-in-law? Screwed! You were right under his nose. He'll be lucky if they let him bust glue sniffers at the hobby shop. The kids? Paging Dr. Phil! 'My daddy's a drug dealer and my mommy turned him in!' And the house? Gone! The feds will come in and RICO her and the kids out on the street. Good luck arguing with them on that, noooo. It's not gonna happen. She's bluffing. And she knows it.
