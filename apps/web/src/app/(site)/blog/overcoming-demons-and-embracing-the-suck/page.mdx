There was a day I could market anything. Big clients, small clients, weird niches – I'd nail the strategy.

Then life got complicated.

A few bad decisions, a project that went sideways, and suddenly fear demons crept in.

I started questioning every word, every campaign. Confidence evaporated. I knew my stuff, but now, the simplest task felt terrifying.

And the worst part? I began to completely hold back on marketing, just when I needed to push harder.

If you’ve been there, you know. Fear is a liar.

It tells you things like:

- I’m no good

- I’ve lost my touch

- Nothing I do works

- Maybe I was never good at this

Sure, fear is normal, we all deal with it. But paralyzing fear? It's crippling.

And last year, it had a death grip on me. Took me months to unwind the damage I’d done.

Everything from inactivity to inaction had left me in a serious funk.

I learned a tough lesson during that time:

Fear doesn't make you cautious. It doesn’t keep you safe. It makes you invisible.

Not just to yourself. To everyone else.

When you're terrified of failing, this happens:

- No bold ideas, the same old tactics everyone else is using. You mimic, you pretend, you coast on someone else’s hard work. Even when you’re still putting yourself out there, it’s vanilla, bland, worthless.

- You procrastinate on everything. That launch? The email sits in drafts for weeks. Social posts never get written. That landing page never gets published.

- You ghost on consistency. All the things you say you’ll do become a promise you never keep. The next day becomes some day and that day becomes never.

This cycle? It's the rhythm of your life. A small burn that slowly eats away at the person you used to be.

But here’s the thing. Allow that to continue and pretty soon, you’ll be a shell. A shell of the person who:

- Thrived in a high-stakes environment

- Faced the fear demons and wrestled them to the ground

- Created magic amid chaos even when chaos threatened to rule the day

So, how do you beat the fear monster and get back in the game?

Here’s what pushes me through.

1. **Embrace the suck.** You will fail sometimes.  But you'll also succeed. It's part of the process. Just don’t let the fails take you so far down a hole that it's hard to claw your way back.

2. **Don't lose track of your why.** Why are you building your business? What are you fighting for? Keep that at the forefront of your mind. Cause without it, the future becomes as murky as that latest launch.

3. **Baby steps.** Don't try to conquer everything at once. Start with one small, scary step each day. Give yourself a win. Crazy what that energy will do.

Remember, every time you face fear head-on, you build your courage muscle. It might feel terrible in the moment. But the most successful people? They aren't fearless.

They're the ones who act despite their fear. And regardless of what you think – you can too.

Let's crush it.
