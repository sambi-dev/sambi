              We&apos;re Sam and Ambreen...and Rebekah. Three principals
              who&apos;ve turned our collective experiences into a powerhouse of
              creativity, strategy, and technology.

              Sam navigated the high seas of enterprise tech and management
              consulting. Rebekah, with a voice that once ruled LA airwaves,
              transitioned into real estate, only to redefine what it means to
              influence in the B2B world. And Ambreen? Her designs didn&apos;t
              just win awards, they captured imaginations.

              Together, we&apos;ve laughed in the face of that&apos;s impossible

              The pandemic threw us a curveball, as it did to the world. We dove
              into newsletters, tinkered with AI editors, and dreamed big. As
              the cash ran out, we regrouped, refocused, and remembered what we
              do best. Turn your ideas into products then thriving companies.

              This isn&apos;t about us being jills of all tradesâ€”though, our
              clients say we&apos;re pretty good at what we do. It&apos;s about
              doing a few things better than almost anyone else and getting
              results.

              Our diet is rich with data. Our workflow powered by continuous

              always on the lookout for the next challenge.
