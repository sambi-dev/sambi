## Background

The brand that replaced the word "paver" with their name in the region is breaking ground again. This time? They‚Äôre not just reshaping landscapes, they're looking to redefine premium interior surfaces.

Their plan? Roll out a new product line that walks in the front door and says, ‚ÄúHoney, I‚Äôm home.‚Äù To make it happen, they see a digital space so welcoming, it‚Äôs set to attract visits, fans, and conversions by the millions‚Äîfrom day one

No pressure.

They needed a partner who thrived in the realm of borderline delusional. An agency where overpromising is practically a cultural cornerstone, unspoken but understood.

## What we're working on

Our synergistic corporate strategy embeds defense mechanisms right in. So when our earlier embellishments are at risk of exposure, we lean in to overwhelming clients with The Full Enchilada.

In this case, we shot back with everything from doodles, to designs, to daily deposits from Stripe. We also like to throw in underused buzzwords like omnichannel, AI-powered, multi-sided platform, open source, and native.

While it's been a rather effective strategy to date, in this case something unexpected happened. Instead of backing off like they usually do, they doubled down and said:

**"When can we start?"** ü´†

## Scope

Ah, The Full Enchilada. In this case, the proverbial concept to completion. We're developing the brand, building an AI-assisted ecommerce platform, the communications strategy, the marketing campaigns, and running everything too.
