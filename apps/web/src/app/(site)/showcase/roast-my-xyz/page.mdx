## Background

Every new client engagement starts with a brutally honest roast of our client's current stuff.

So we figured we'd wrap some pretty designs around it and launch a whole new acquisition machine around it.ðŸ’¡ðŸ’°

We built a slick ecommerce site, put together some killer service packages, and planned a launch that would make Apple jealous.

But then, we kind of forgot to tell anyone about it. Oops. ðŸ™Š

We got sidetracked by other shiny objects and the project went stale.

Fast forward to 2024, and the Twitterverse is buzzing with design bros offering roast services left and right. And here we are, feeling like the hipsters who listened to that indie band before they were cool.

## What we built

We put together an open-source ecommerce platform that was as fast as lighting. Powered by Shopify's Headless API and built with all the cool kids' tools like Next.js and Typescript.

We even tied it into our agency workflows and communication systems, because we're extra like that.

But here's the kicker, we gave it all away for free. Yep, we open-sourced the whole shebang. Turns out, it actually helped a bunch of developers who followed through with their own roasting services.

Oh, and we did get to use some of the tech for a couple of other client projects, so it wasn't a total loss.

## Scope

This project was a smorgasbord of our skills. We're talking ecommerce, open-source development, and even some agency workflow integration. We went all-in on this one. ðŸ”¥

  We thought roasting designs would be our claim to fame. Turns out, we were
  just ahead of the curve. By the time design roasts went viral, we had already
  moved on to critiquing AI spiral art.
