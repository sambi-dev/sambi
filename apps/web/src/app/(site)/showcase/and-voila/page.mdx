## Background

Agencies everywhere have found the secret to being creative. They let AI do the work and take the credit. Who needs human writers when you have algorithms that can make content with a click?

We jumped on this trend and made our own AI workflow. Our goal? To help people fill the internet with boring, repetitive blog posts.

But wait. Does being original matter? If AI writes it, who owns it?

Most people don't ask these questions. We could have ignored them too. But we didn't.

## What we built

We decided to do things differently. In a world full of AI noise, we wanted to save the human side of creativity.

We thought that in most cases, protecting your ideas is actually pretty important.

What if any AI writing tool could easily prove that a human wrote something? As easy as using Stripe for payments.

And Voila, like a blue tickâ€”that you can't pay forâ€”that says "A human wrote this".

## Scope

This project needed everything we got. We call it The Full Enchilada. Brand strategy, content marketing, and everything in between. We did it all. ðŸŒ®
