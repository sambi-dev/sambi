# sambi.dev Web App

Welcome to the sambi.dev web app, the digital face of our un-agency! This app is part of the larger sambi Turborepo, where we showcase our work, share our stories, and connect with like-minded folks.

## Built on the Shoulders of Giants

This app is powered by the mighty [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/), a powerful combination of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org), [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and [tRPC](https://trpc.io). It's like having a superhero team backing your app.

But we didn't stop there. We've also incorporated:

- ðŸŽ¨ [Tailwind UI templates](https://tailwindui.com/) (subject to their License) by the makers of Tailwind CSS to help speed things up.
- ðŸª„ [shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/), a collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable components that you can easily integrate into your app.
- ðŸš€ [Basehub](https://basehub.com/home), for fast, collaborative, and AI-native content management.

## Getting Started

To get this party started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Set up your environment variables (see `.env.example` for what you'll need)
4. Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning. We've set up the scaffolding, but it's up to you to make it your own. Add features, experiment with designs, integrate new tools. The sky's the limit.
